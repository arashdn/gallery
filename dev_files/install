- create db and add tables.
- set db info in config/database.php
- add encryption key to config/config.php (in *nix oses : openssl rand -base64 32);
To take maximum advantage of the encryption algorithm, your key should be 32 characters in length (128 bits). The key should be as random a string as you can concoct, with numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters. Your key should not be a simple text string. In order to be cryptographically secure it needs to be as random as possible.
- chmod /tmp/captcha 777
- set $config['sess_cookie_name'] in config/config.php
